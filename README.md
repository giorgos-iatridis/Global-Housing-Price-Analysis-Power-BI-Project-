# Global-Housing-Price-Analysis-Power-BI-Project-

This project explores key socioeconomic indicators across different countries using Power BI.
The analysis is based on three main datasets:

- Housing prices and related property indicators
- Global unemployment rates
- Net household income by country

By combining these datasets, the project aims to provide insights into how housing markets, unemployment, and household income interact on a global scale. The final dashboards highlight trends, comparisons across countries, and potential correlations between these critical socioeconomic factors.

## Data

The data I'm going to use in this project is included in three tables.
1. Global housing prices and other important indexes (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-housing-market-analysis-2015-2024)
2. Unemployment data by Age, Year and Country (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-unemployment-data)
3. Net primary income (for Adults) of households and NPISH (source: https://wid.world/data/)

## Data Cleaning

First, I did some very important transformations in my tables.
